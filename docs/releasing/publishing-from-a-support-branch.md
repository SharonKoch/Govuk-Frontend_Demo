# Publishing from a support branch

This document is for GOV.UK Design System developers who need to publish a support branch of GOV.UK Frontend. For example, you might need to release a fix as part of a:

- patch release, after the team has started to merge changes for a new feature release into the `main` branch - for example, a 3.14.x release once we've started merging changes for 3.15.0
- release, after the team has started to merge changes for a new breaking release into the `main` branch - for example, a 3.x.x release once we've started merging changes for 4.0.0
- release for a previous major version - for example, a 4.x.x release after we've released 5.0.0

If you want to publish the `main` branch for GOV.UK Frontend, [follow the steps in Publishing GOV.UK Frontend](/docs/releasing/publishing.md).

If the `main` branch only has a few unreleasable changes, you can temporarily revert these changes.

1. Revert the unreleasable changes on the `main` branch.
2. Publish GOV.UK Frontend.
3. Add the reverted changes back into the `main` branch.

However, this approach has risks. For example, it creates a messy commit history on the `main` branch.

## Before you publish GOV.UK Frontend

Read the docs for [what to do before publishing a release](/docs/releasing/before-publishing-a-release.md) to ensure you are prepared to publish.

## Publish a new version of GOV.UK Frontend from the support branch

### Change the code

1. Find out which major version this release will be targeting, for example, if you're releasing v4.x.x, the major version is version 4. To check out the support branch for that major version, run `git checkout support/<MAJOR VERSION NUMBER>.x`. If the branch does not exist, follow these steps to create it:

   - make sure you have all tags locally by running `git fetch --all --tags --prune`
   - run `git checkout tags/v<LAST RELEASED VERSION NUMBER> -b support/<CURRENT MAJOR VERSION NUMBER>.x` - for example, `git checkout tags/v3.9.1 -b support/3.x`

2. Run `nvm use` to make sure you’re using the right version of Node.js and npm.

3. Push the support branch to GitHub. The branch will automatically have branch protection rules applied.

4. Create a new branch for your code changes (for example, `git checkout -b fix-the-thing`) from the `support/<MAJOR VERSION NUMBER>.x` branch.

5. Run `npm install` to make sure you have the latest dependencies installed.

6. Make your code changes, and test them following our [standard testing requirements](/docs/contributing/testing.md).

7. Update the changelog with details of the fix.

8. Commit your changes, then push your new branch (see step 4) to GitHub and raise a pull request, with `support/<MAJOR VERSION NUMBER>.x` as the base branch to merge into.

9. Once a developer approves the pull request, merge it into `support/<MAJOR VERSION NUMBER>.x`. It’s usually a developer who reviews the pull request, but sometimes pull requests need an extra review from another role. For example, if the pull request involves a design change, you may need a review from a designer.

### Build a new release

1. Check out `support/<MAJOR VERSION NUMBER>.x`.

2. Create and check out a new branch, `support-release-[version-number]`. The version number of the new release depends on the type of release. New features correspond to a minor (X.1.X) change - for example, '3.14.0 (Feature release)'. Fixes correspond to a patch (X.X.1) change - for example, '3.13.1 (Patch release)'. In either case, refer to the previous release of that kind, and give the new release the logical next number. To learn more about our versioning, see our [guidance on updating the changelog](/docs/contributing/versioning.md#updating-changelog).

3. Run `nvm use` to make sure you’re using the right version of Node.js and npm.

4. Run `npm install` to make sure you have the latest dependencies installed.

5. In the CHANGELOG.md, replace the 'Unreleased' heading with the new version number and its release type. For example, '3.14.1 (Fix release)'. Also add a new 'Unreleased' heading above this new heading, so people raising new pull requests know where to add them in the changelog.

6. Update the `package/package.json` version with the new version number.

7. Save the changes. Do not commit.

8. Run `npm run build-release` to:

- build GOV.UK Frontend into the `/package` and `/dist` directories
- commit the changes
- push a branch to GitHub

  You will now be prompted to continue or cancel.

9. Raise a pull request, with `support/<MAJOR VERSION NUMBER>.x` as the base branch to merge into.

10. Once a developer approves the pull request, merge it into `support/<MAJOR VERSION NUMBER>.x`.

### Publish the release to npm

1. Check out `support/<MAJOR VERSION NUMBER>.x` and pull the latest changes.

2. Sign in to npm (`npm login`), using the credentials for the govuk-patterns-and-tools npm user from Bitwarden.

3. Run `npm run publish-release`, which will prompt you to check whether the npm tag looks as expected.

If you're publishing a release for a previous major version, do not tag this release as the 'latest' release on npm. Instead, give the tag the format `latest-[major-version-number]`, for example, `latest-4`.

Enter `y` to continue. If you think the tag should be different, enter `N` to have the option to set your own npm tag.

4. You will now be prompted to continue or cancel the release. Check the details and enter `y` to continue. If something does not look right, press `N` to cancel the release.

5. View the created tag in the [GitHub interface](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases) as follows:

   - select the most recent tag
   - press **Edit tag**
   - set ‘GOV.UK Frontend v[version-number]’ as the title
   - add release notes from changelog
   - attach the generated ZIP that has been generated at the root of this project
   - publish release

6. Run `npm logout` to sign out from npm.

## After you publish the new release

Read the docs for [what to do after publishing a release](/docs/releasing/after-publishing-a-release.md).

## Update the `main` branch (optional)

1. Check out the `main` branch and pull the latest changes.

2. Run `nvm use` and `npm install` to make sure you have the latest dependencies installed.

3. Make the same changes as in the patch fix pull request, and test them using our [standard testing requirements](/docs/contributing/testing.md). Remember that `main` will contain changes the support branch did not have, which might affect the code changes you’ll need to make.

4. Also update the [CHANGELOG.md](/CHANGELOG.md) with this change. Add a new ‘Unreleased’ heading above the change, so people raising new pull requests know where to add them in the changelog. Remember that the pull request links in the changelog notes will need to link to the pull requests against the `main` branch.

5. Commit your changes.

6. Push your branch to GitHub and raise a pull request, with `main` as the base branch to merge into.

7. Once a developer approves the pull request, merge it into the `main` branch.
