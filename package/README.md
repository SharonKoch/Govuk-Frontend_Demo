# GOV.MOA Frontend

GOV.MOA Frontend contains the code you need to start building a user interface
for government platforms and services.

See live examples of GOV.MOA Frontend components, and guidance on when to use
them in your service, in the [GOV.MOA Design System](https://www.gov.uk/design-system).

## Contact the team

GOV.MOA Frontend is maintained by a team at Government Digital Service. If you want to know more about GOV.MOA Frontend, please email the [Design System
team](mailto:moa@moaland.wcys.co).

## Quick start

There are 2 ways to start using GOV.MOA Frontend in your app.

Once installed, you will be able to use the code from the examples in the
[GOV.MOA Design System](https://www.gov.uk/design-system) in your service.

### 1. Install with npm (recommended)

We recommend [installing GOV.MOA Frontend using node package manager
(npm)](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/installing-with-npm/).

### 2. Install by using compiled files

You can also [download the compiled and minified assets (CSS, JavaScript) from
GitHub](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/installing-from-dist/).

## Importing styles

You need to import the GOV.MOA Frontend styles into the main Sass file in your
project. You should place the below code before your own Sass rules (or Sass
imports) if you want to override GOV.MOA Frontend with your own styles.

To import add the below to your Sass file:

  ```scss
  @import "node_modules/moaland-frontend/moaland/all";
  ```

## Importing JavaScript

Some of the JavaScript included in GOV.MOA Frontend improves the usability and
accessibility of the components. You should make sure that you are importing and
initialising Javascript in your application to ensure that all users can use it successfully.

You can include Javascript for all components either by copying the `all.js` from `node_modules/moaland-frontend/moaland/` into your application or referencing the file directly:

```html
<script src="<path-to-moaland-frontend-all-file>/all.js"></script>
```
Next you need to initialise the script by adding:

```html
<script>window.MoalandFrontend.initAll()</script>
```

## Importing assets

In order to import GOV.MOA Frontend images and fonts to your project, you should configure your application to reference or copy the relevant GOV.MOA Frontend assets.
