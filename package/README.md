# Navody.Digital Frontend

âš  **Warning** This package is currently under heavy development and thus not recommended for general use. Feel free to [reach out](https://slovensko-digital.slack.com/messages/CEGR9AZT5) to us if you're thinking about using it.

## Quick start

There are 2 ways to start using Navody.Digital Frontend in your app.

Once installed, you will be able to use the code from the examples from
[frontend.navody.digital](https://frontend.navody.digital) in your service.

### 1. Install with npm (recommended)

We recommend [installing Navody.Digital Frontend using node package manager
(npm)](https://github.com/slovensko-digital/navody-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/installing-with-npm.md).

### 2. Install by using compiled files

You can also [download the compiled and minified assets (CSS, JavaScript) from
GitHub](https://github.com/slovensko-digital/navody-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/installing-from-dist.md).

## Importing styles

You need to import the Navody.Digital Frontend styles into the main Sass file in your
project. You should place the below code before your own Sass rules (or Sass
imports) if you want to override Navody.Digital Frontend with your own styles.

To import add the below to your Sass file:

  ```scss
  @import "node_modules/navody-digital-frontend/all";
  ```

## Importing JavaScript

Some of the JavaScript included in Navody.Digital Frontend improves the usability and
accessibility of the components. You should make sure that you are importing and
initialising Javascript in your application to ensure that all users can use it successfully.

You can include Javascript for all components either by copying the `all.js` from `node_modules/navody-digital-frontend` into your application or referencing the file directly:

```html
<script src="<path-to-navody-digital-frontend-all-file>/all.js"></script>
```
Next you need to initialise the script by adding:

```html
<script>window.navodyDigitalFrontend.initAll()</script>
```

## Importing assets

In order to import Navody.Digital Frontend images and fonts to your project, you should configure your application to reference or copy the relevant Navody.Digital Frontend assets.
